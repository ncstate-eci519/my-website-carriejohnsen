    <h2>EdTech Tools</h2>
    
    <h3>Quizlet</h3>
    <body>I like quizlet because it allows students to learn new vocabulary in a new and fun way.  Students are then able to go back and review these words in different ways through matching games, flashcards, and gravity. Students are also able to take practice vocabulary test.</body>

     <h3>Quizizz</h3>
     <body>Another website that students are able to review new information or be introducuced to a new topic.I have used Quiziss before to help my students learn the Mummification Process.  This website also allows for teachers to assign a Quizizz as a homework assignment or complete in class.</body>

    <h3>EdPuzzle</h3>
     <body>EdPuzzle is a site that allows students to watch a video and for teachers to check for understanding as they are watching it.  Video's can be assigned to be watched independently or watched together as a class.  During virtual teaching using EdPuzzle has allowed me to verify how students are participating in class and paying attention.</body>
